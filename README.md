# Agri Ardupilot - sub-version for ardupilot with abilities for advanced crop spraying

ArduPilot is the most advanced, full-featured, and reliable open source autopilot software available.
It has been under development since 2010 by a diverse team of professional engineers, computer scientists, and community contributors.
Our autopilot software is capable of controlling almost any vehicle system imaginable, from conventional airplanes, quad planes, multi-rotors, and helicopters to rovers, boats, balance bots, and even submarines.
It is continually being expanded to provide support for new emerging vehicle types.

Agri-Ardupilot is a sub-version for ardupilot (stable version 4.2) with abilities for doing advanced crop spraying. The features added are:
1. Advancing sprayer part with lots of feature for using sprayer pump.
2. Adding some new spraying manouver for spot spraying (known as garden spraying).
3. Utilizing nozzle spraying with different modes of spraying.
4. Two new mavlink commands for automizing the sprayer.

Please notify us if there is any problem in using this repository. Also, I will clone a sub-version for QGroundControl which is optimized for crop spraying missions.
